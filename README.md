ReChar integrates three distinct yet interrelated modules: (1) a character structure extraction module, which is designed to preserve the integrity of the character's form, (2) an element generation module, responsible for producing user-defined decorative elements based on textual input, and (3) a style extraction module, aimed at capturing the visual style from a reference image provided by the user. These components are subsequently fused in a controllable synthesis step, which enables flexible and user-customized image generation. To provide a clearer understanding of our approach, we will illustrate the generation process of an instance through a detailed case study.
